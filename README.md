# AadGraphHelper
This tool let's you, a developer, create request for AAD Graph API, issue the request and get the response. 
The responses can be viewed in a table format (instead of raw JSON) which makes visualization easier, although 
only simple non-null values are exposed in the table. The requests can be saved as templates that can be opened 
up later, and issued against different tenants. Finally, it also has a filter query builder that can let you 
compose a search for users, convert it into a filter query string that can be issued as a request.
